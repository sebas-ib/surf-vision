**Categorizing Waves with Computer Vision**
As surfers (and soon to be ones), we want to understand 
wave patterns to improve our & others surfing experience.

AI technique weâ€™ll use: **Convolutional Neural Networks**

**Why Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)?**
- Capture spatial hierarchies
  - Excellent for identifying patterns and features in waves
- Effective recognizing patterns regardless of position
  - Varying wave positions
- Robust to variations in lighting, angle, and scale 
  - Natural environment pictures
- Lots of research, tools, and libraries available
